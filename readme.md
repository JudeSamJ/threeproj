# Three.js Interactive Objects

This HTML file showcases an interactive Three.js scene with various 3D objects, including a cube, torus, cone, particle system for fireworks, and 3D text. The objects rotate and move, and you can interact with them by clicking on them to display their specifications.

## How to Run the Code

1. Download the HTML file: [index.html](index.html)
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser that supports WebGL.

## Procedure

- Upon opening the HTML file in a web browser, you will see a 3D scene with a rotating cube, torus, cone, particle system simulating fireworks, and 3D text.
- Click on any of the objects (cube, torus, cone) to display their specifications in the top-left corner of the screen.

## Result

- The scene demonstrates the capabilities of Three.js in creating interactive 3D environments.
- Each clickable object provides information about its specifications when clicked.

Feel free to explore the interactive Three.js scene and enjoy the visual effects!

**Note:** Ensure an internet connection when running the code, as it fetches the Three.js library from an external source.
